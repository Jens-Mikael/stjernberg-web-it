    "description": "I'm Jens-Mikael Stjernberg, an 18-year-old young entrepreneur from Finland. I've been programming for four years already, and although I'm still in high school, I passionately build professional-level web projects.\n\nI founded Stjernberg Web and IT Services in fall 2024, when traditional summer jobs no longer inspired me and I wanted to take on new challenges as an entrepreneur in the world of software. Since then, Iâ€™ve completed numerous IT projects globally â€“ not only in Finland, but also in the United States and Germany.\n\nMusic and sports have always been important to me. When Iâ€™m not coding, I play the guitar or piano, or I hit the gym hard enough to make walking difficult the next day.\n\nI come from a multilingual entrepreneurial family from Norway. At home, we speak three languages: Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian. In addition, I speak fluent English and have studied German in school for five years.\n\nSo, if you're looking for passionate and multilingual IT help, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch â€“ letâ€™s make your vision a reality!"
